# Recursion
Recursion using Haskell 
In this assignment you will create three functions. They should be based on recursion.

1. Create a function named isPrime that takes a number n as a parameter and determines if it is a prime number. It should be true if it is a prime number, 
and false if it is not a prime number. Please note that primes start with 2.

2. Create a function named factorial that takes a number n as a parameter. The function calculates the factorial of a number.

3. Create a function named fibonacci that takes a number n as a parameter. The function should show the nth fibonacci number in the sequence. 
Please note that the fibonacci series starts with 1,1,2,3,5,...
